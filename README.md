2016 Presidential Election Data -- Exploration 

This R file explores data from the 2016 presidential election that were published the the Federal Election Commission (fec.gov). 
As I've pulled in different data files, I credit and explain them. 

Some of the data I'm interested in include individual contribution data, corporate contribution data, partisan affiliation, and other features.
